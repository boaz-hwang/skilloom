# consolidate

Bring overlapping skills together without losing what works.

Consolidate compares multiple skills by their outcomes and requirements. It proposes useful merges and keeps distinct roles separate when a merge would add complexity.

## Install

```text
Clone https://github.com/boaz-hwang/skilloom and install skills/consolidate as consolidate in your skills directory.
```

## Use

```text
Use consolidate to review <skill-folder>, propose suitable merges, and consolidate after I confirm the plan.
```

## How it works

1. Compare outcomes, constraints, resources, and accepted examples.
2. Confirm which sources map to which targets and what stays separate.
3. Build minimal replacements and verify capabilities from each source.
4. Apply the approved mapping, retire approved duplicates, and preserve rollback.

If preservation cannot be verified, the originals stay active and the candidate is kept separately. Finding nothing to merge is also a valid result.
